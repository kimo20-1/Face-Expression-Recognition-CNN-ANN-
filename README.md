# Face-Expression-Recognition-CNN-ANN-

Facial expression recognition is the task of classifying the expressions on face images into various categories such as anger, fear, surprise, sadness, happiness and so on. Emotional facial expressions can inform researchers about an individual's emotional state.

This repository contains code for automated facial expression recognition using artificial neural networks (ANNs), specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The code is written in Python using the Keras deep learning framework.

## Dataset

The code in this repository is based on the [FER2013 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013), which contains facial expression images categorized into seven emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

CNNs are a type of artificial neural network that are commonly used for image classification tasks. They are particularly effective at recognizing spatial patterns in images, making them well-suited for facial expression recognition.

## Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)

ANNs are a family of machine learning models inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks. They are composed of interconnected nodes that process and transmit information, allowing them to learn complex relationships and patterns in data.
